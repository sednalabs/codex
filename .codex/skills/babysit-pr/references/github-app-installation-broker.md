# GitHub App installation broker

`github_app_installation_broker.py` is a one-shot transport boundary for the
PR observer. It gives one selected repository a short-lived GitHub App
installation token while keeping the operator's personal token out of the
child process. Phase A is development-ready and read-only; it does not prove a
live installation or production commissioning.

## Inputs and scope

The broker requires an App ID, installation ID, installation account, one
`OWNER/REPOSITORY` selection, and an explicit permission object. The permitted
permission values are `read` for `metadata`, `contents`, `pull_requests`,
`merge_queues`, `checks`, `actions`, `statuses`, and (only when explicitly
requested) `administration`. Unknown permissions and all write or admin values
are rejected. Before minting, the installation endpoint is checked for the
expected App/installation/account identity and for a grant covering every
requested permission. The access-token request always carries exactly one
repository name and the requested subset.

The private key is loaded only from the fixed basename below the systemd
`CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY` (normally supplied with `LoadCredential=`). Arbitrary
paths, environment-held key contents, stdin keys, worktree files, symlinks, and
group/world-writable sources are rejected. The key is passed to the inherited
file descriptor of `openssl dgst -sha256 -sign`; it is never an argument,
environment value, log field, or returned result. The App JWT uses GitHub's
RS256 header and short `iat`/`exp` claims and is never printed.

## One-shot execution

Use the non-minting fingerprint operation first and bind its output in the
caller. The fingerprint covers the selected repository, normalized
permissions, complete argv, executable identity and SHA-256 bytes for the
executable and any path-like script arguments. A changed command, script,
source mode, or selected permission set fails closed.

The `exec` operation validates that fingerprint, caches exactly one installation
token in process memory, strips ambient `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and related
GitHub token variables, and injects only the freshly validated token as
`GH_TOKEN`. Child stdout/stderr are bounded and redacted. Results contain only
the non-secret App/installation/account/repository identity, expiry,
permissions, rate-limit headers, exit status, and redacted output. There is no
PAT fallback and no App-user-token fallback.

The cached token is reused until the positive near-expiry threshold, then
refreshed once. It is never persisted. Normal and exceptional exits call
`DELETE /installation/token`; revocation failure is reported as a non-secret
status and must be treated as an operational follow-up, not silently ignored.
HTTP requests use the GitHub API version header, HTTPS origin pinning,
redirect/cross-host rejection, bounded response bodies, strict JSON/type
checks, and finite timeouts.

Example (with generic credential naming):

```sh
python3 github_app_installation_broker.py fingerprint \
  --app-id 123 --installation-id 456 --account example-org \
  --repo example-org/codex --permissions '{"metadata":"read","contents":"read"}' \
  -- /usr/local/bin/codex-pr-observer --once

python3 github_app_installation_broker.py exec \
  --app-id 123 --installation-id 456 --account example-org \
  --repo example-org/codex --permissions '{"metadata":"read","contents":"read"}' \
  --fingerprint BOUND_FINGERPRINT -- /usr/local/bin/codex-pr-observer --once
```

The service unit should use `LoadCredential=` and let systemd set
`CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY`; it should not place key contents in an environment
file or command line. Rotate the App key and installation permissions through
the provider's administrative process, then restart the one-shot unit. A
rollback restores the previously recorded broker script and exact command
fingerprint, followed by a fresh fingerprint and hosted validation. Revoke any
token left by an interrupted process before retrying.

## Validation and promotion

The secret-free test file uses only mocked HTTP responses and temporary test
fixtures. It covers permission reduction and selected-repository binding, JWT
claim construction without material exposure, cache reuse and near-expiry
refresh, ambient-token stripping, fingerprint and path safety, body and
redirect bounds, redaction, success/failure revocation, and the no-fallback
boundary. Hosted `codex.agent-workflow-sanity` runs the broker's compile and
test commands. Live installation/token proof, broader repositories, write
permissions, and production commissioning remain outside the Phase A cutline.
