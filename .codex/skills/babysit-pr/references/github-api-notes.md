# GitHub CLI / API Notes For `babysit-pr`

## Primary commands used

### PR metadata

- `gh pr view --json number,url,state,mergedAt,closedAt,headRefName,headRefOid,headRepository,headRepositoryOwner`

Used to resolve PR number, URL, branch, head SHA, and closed/merged state.

### PR checks summary

- `gh pr checks --json name,state,bucket,link,workflow,event,startedAt,completedAt`

Used to compute pending/failed/passed counts and whether the current CI round is terminal.

### Workflow runs for head SHA

- `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs -X GET -f head_sha=<sha> -f per_page=100`

Used to discover failed workflow runs and rerunnable run IDs.

### Failed log inspection

- `gh run view <run-id> --json jobs,name,workflowName,conclusion,status,url,headSha`
- `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/jobs -X GET -f per_page=100`
- `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/jobs/{job_id}/logs > /tmp/codex-gh-job-{job_id}-logs.zip`
- `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`

Used by Codex to classify branch-related vs flaky/unrelated failures. Prefer the direct job log endpoint as soon as a job has failed because `gh run view --log-failed` may not produce failed-job logs until the overall workflow run completes.

### Retry failed jobs only

- `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`

Reruns only failed jobs (and dependencies) for a workflow run.

## Review-related endpoints

- Issue comments on PR:
  - `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<pr_number>/comments?per_page=100`
- Inline PR review comments:
  - `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr_number>/comments?per_page=100`
- Review submissions:
  - `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr_number>/reviews?per_page=100`
- Live review-thread state:
  - `gh api graphql -f query='query($owner:String!,$name:String!,$number:Int!,$cursor:String){ repository(owner:$owner,name:$name){ pullRequest(number:$number){ reviewThreads(first:100,after:$cursor){ pageInfo{hasNextPage endCursor} nodes{ id isResolved isOutdated path line comments(first:100){ nodes{ databaseId url body createdAt author{login} pullRequestReview{ databaseId url state author{login} } } } } } } } }' -F owner=<owner> -F name=<repo> -F number=<pr_number>`

Use the GraphQL `reviewThreads` view to decide whether review-comment history still reflects a current unresolved blocker. Historical review comments/submissions may remain in REST history after their threads are resolved; the watcher should treat those as non-actionable unless the live thread is still unresolved or the operator explicitly wants to resurface them.
